# Description
<p>LoginDemo.SwiftUI is a simple project which was developed to learn 'SwiftUI' and to be a base library to future apps that need an authentication process.<br>
The project consists of a simple sign in view that validates email (username) and password, enabling a submit button in case of success. It also disables the user interaction during the sign in process meanwhile shows a loading indicator that gives feedback to the user. Also it can show an alert in case of error from the API.<br>
ðŸš§ The project also will have a forgot password and sign up sections, which are in construction.
